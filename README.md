UofD Data Analysis Bootcamp Module 12 Challenge

The primary files are: NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb, NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb, and a Resources directory. The Resources directory contains the establishments.json file that has been modified by NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and is used by both NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb and NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb.

I used the format provided by the Starter-Code files provided.
